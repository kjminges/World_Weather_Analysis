# Module 6 Assignment - World Weather Analysis

## Background
After receiving feedback on the beta version of the PlanMyTrip app, our team has decided to incorporate a few of these changes into the newest version of the app. The most important change is to include additional data regarding the cities that make up the database. The change will add a quick description of the current weather into the existing weather data that was already retrieved for our city database.

In addition to the feedback driven changes discussed above, we have also decided to add a new feature to the app that will allow users to plan trips among multiple cities (up to 4) all within their temperature limits. Once the user inputs the limits, they will be able to select up to 4 cities and hotels (hotel location used for more accurate directions) for their trip itinerary and the app will automatically generate a directions map and detailed information about each hotel. 

These changes should provide users with the additional functionality that they have been looking for. 

## Navigation
For the back-up code used to generate and retrieve the weather data for our city database, please see the Weather_Database folder. For the code and output that generates the custom travel destinations map, see the Vacation_Search folder. Finally, all the code and output from the travel itinerary work can be found in the Vacation_Itinerary folder.
